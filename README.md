# Pokedex

This is Pokedex app built with NextJS, Typescript and Tailwindcss

!!! Attention: `apps/pokedex-redux` is page router and `apps/pokedex` is app router

Because the module `next-redux-wrapper` is only available for pages router of NextJS application, `pokedex-redux` is built with pages router and `@mui/x-data-grid` is used for first page

## What kind of this project?

This project is monorepo powered by [Turborepo](http://turbo.build) including apps and packages

They share config files for typescript, eslint, tailwindcss

## What's inside?

This Turborepo includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `pokedex-redux (apps/pokedex-redux)`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) in Pages router with next-redux-wrapper and @reduxjs/toolkit
- `pokedex (apps/pokedex)`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) in App router with @tanstack/react-query and storybook
- `@repo/ui`: a stub React component library with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) shared by both `pokedex-redux` and `pokedex` applications
- `@repo/types`: an ESM module with type definition with typescript shared by whole project
- `@repo/utils`: a stub NodeJS library with Typescript shared by both `pokedex-redux` and `pokedex` applications
- `@repo/eslint-config (packages/config-eslint)`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `@repo/typescript-config (packages/config-typescript)`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo
- `@repo/tailwind-config (packages/config-tailwind)`: `tailwind.config.ts`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Deployment

#### Kubernetes

This repository contains kubernetes files for deployment

- `.kubernetes/backendconfig.yaml`: Load balancer Backend configuration for network endpoints being applied to service for ingress ([What is backend service](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/backend-service))
- `.kubernetes/web-config.yaml`: !! GENERATED BY GITHUB ACTION DYNAMICALLY!!! contains configuration environment variables
- `.kubernetes/web-deployment.yaml`: Deploy pod(s) to kubernetes cluster with workload name `web`
- `.kubernetes/web-service.yaml`: Expose deployed pod as service and configure backend service
- `.kubernetes/web-ingress.yaml`: Expose service as ingress and attach special domain (optional) to the service
- `.kubernetes/kustomization.yaml`: Kustomization configuration file to run the kubernetes files

#### Github action

Also we have github action `.github/workflows/web.yml` to run the kubernetes files with Kustomization

We need some env vars to run the workflows on github action

- `environment/production/secrets/GCP_CREDENTIALS`: service account credentials from google service used for authentication (plz don't forget to make as plain text to store. remove any \r\t)
- `environment/production/secrets/GKE_PROJECT`: project id of google cloud platform
- `environment/production/vars/GAR_LOCATION`: location config for your artifact repository (e.g. us-central1)
- `environment/production/vars/GKE_CLUSTER`: cluster id of kubernetes engine
- `environment/production/vars/GKE_LOCATION`: location config for your google kubernetes cluster (e.g. us-central1)
- `environment/production/vars/GAR_REPOSITORY`: repository name of google artifact repository you use to store your docker images built from code
- `environment/production/vars/NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`: this is used to set env var to build the docker image and run container (pointed on `/.env.example`)

what does this github action do?

- Checkout the repository
- Authenticate to google cloud platform by service account JSON
- Authenticate to docker and kubernetes engine
- Build the docker image and publish to artifacts repository
- Download portable kustomization file
- Generate web-config.yaml file dynamically based on env var `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
- Run kubernetes to deploy on GKE
